PROMPT 001:
METER: 3/4

TITLE
Bars 1-8 — Jazzy isomorphic quartal and quintal harmonies, chords. Compose exactly 8 bars in a 3/4 meter.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
Use this single instrument and no others:
[piano].

RHYTHM:
The chords should be quarter note long each. Each pitch that should belong to the same chord should have the same time value (meaning that the transformation should add 0 for pitches belonging to the same chord when building features).


HARD RANGES (MIDI NUMBERS — MUST STAY INSIDE)
- grand_piano: [21..108]
- Use ONLY these instruments. Emit exactly one PT/run_plan pair per instrument above; no extras.

METER & GRID FOR THIS UNIT
- Ticks per bar: 12
- Seeds must set numerator=3, denominator=4 (transforms add 0)

RANGE REMINDER
Design pitch seeds and add/sub steps so that the simulated pitches never exceed the hard ranges;
if a step would leave the range, reflect direction immediately to remain inside. No external clamping.


SUMMARY 001:
UNIT 001: bars=8, total_ticks=96, meter=3/4
- grand_piano: notes=24, pitch[48..79], avg_vel=79.2, last_pitch=60, last_on=92, last_end=96
