PROMPT 001:
METER: 3/4

TITLE
Bar 1 — Jazzy isomorphic quartal and quintal harmonies, chords. 

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
Use this single instrument and no others:
[piano].

FORM FOR THIS PROMPT
Compose exactly one bar (12 ticks at 1/16 grid). All notes must end ≤ tick 12. Realize the above purely through your PT design (transformations + seeds). Return a single bundle with exactly one feature (for the piano) and a run_plan that produces the line as specified.


HARD RANGES (MIDI NUMBERS — MUST STAY INSIDE)
- grand_piano: [21..108]
- Use ONLY these instruments. Emit exactly one PT/run_plan pair per instrument above; no extras.

METER & GRID FOR THIS UNIT
- Ticks per bar: 12
- Seeds must set numerator=3, denominator=4 (transforms add 0)

RANGE REMINDER
Design pitch seeds and add/sub steps so that the simulated pitches never exceed the hard ranges;
if a step would leave the range, reflect direction immediately to remain inside. No external clamping.

- grand_piano: notes=3, pitch[57..81], avg_vel=68.6, last_pitch=62, last_on=8, last_end=12
